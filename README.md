# MIMIC-IV

This repository contains exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data cleaning for the extracted MIMIC-IV data. This project was completed as part of a Statistics class at Langara College. The data was extracted using Snowflake from the MIMIC-IV v0.4 database. All code is written in Python.

## EDA and Data Cleaning

The EDA and data cleaning steps performed in this project include:

- Univariate variable analysis
- Bivariate variable analysis
- Handling duplicates and missing values
- Detecting multidimensional outliers
- Checking for multicollinearity

The cleaned data is prepared for the next phase of the project, which involves comparing the performance of dimensionality reduction techniques, specifically Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Linear Optimal Low-Rank Projection (LOL).
